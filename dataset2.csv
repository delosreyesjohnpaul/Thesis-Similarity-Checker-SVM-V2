 Documents"," Plagiarism occurs when we use the ideas, expressions, work, and words of other authors and do not give them the required
 attribution. The major contributing factor in plagiarism is the availability of a high amount of data and information on the
 internet that can be swiftly accessed. The proposed system introduces an extrinsic plagiarism detection approach inspired by
 cognition because it utilizes semantic knowledge to detect the plagiarized part from the text without human involvement. A
 lexical database like WordNet assists the computers to perceive the data and information. These days most of the plagiarism
 detection systems fail to detect highly complex cases of plagiarism. The proposed system uses Dice measure as similarity
 measureforfindingthesemanticresemblancebetweenthepairofsentences.Italsouseslinguistic features like path similarity,
 depth estimation measure to computetheresemblancebetweenthepairofwordsandthesefeaturesarecombinedbyassigning
 different weights to them. It is capable of identifying cases like restructuring, paraphrasing, verbatim copy, and synonymized
 plagiarism. It has been evaluated on the PAN-PC-11 corpus. The results obtained from the proposed system signify that it
 has outperformed other existing systems on PAN-PC-11 in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and PlagDet score. The
 proposed system has innovative approach, but the results are somehow close and reasonably better than the existing systems.",1

2,Meeting the challenges of global rice production,rice is the second most widely grown cereal crop and the staple food for more than half the worlds population more than  billion people consume more than  kg of rice per year rice is cultivated on  million ha with an average growth rate of  a year in the last  years in the near future the possibility for expanding areas under ricebased systems will remain very limited because of the scarcity of global water resources for agriculture the expansion of urban and industrial sectors in asia where land is already limited and the high costs of developing new lands that are suited for rice production in subsaharan africa and latin america the average growth rate of rice yield was  per year in the early s but it has decreased to  per year in the late s several factors may contribute to the decline of the area under cultivation and in yield growth the most important of these factors are limited returns as we approach the yield potential of the high yielding varieties declining productivity in intensive rice production systems pressures from abiotic and biotic stresses low returns in developing countries increasing production costs in industrialized countries and increasing public concern for the protection of environmental resources one of the most effective means of addressing the issues in rice cultivation and raising the average yields at the farm level is through research and subsequent dissemination of the resulting data rice science has made considerable progress in the area of rice varietal improvement recent advances in hybrid rice and the new rice for africa nerica are just two examples of the successful contributions of science to the development of rice research could also help reduce the gap between the potential yield obtained on experimental stations and the actual yield obtained in the fields this could be possible by developing and promoting rice integrated crop management ricm systems for improving productivity and reducing the production cost per unit of output the need for a sustainable increase in rice production affects everyone the international year of rice provide us with a chance to improve food security alleviate poverty and preserve the environment for the billions of people for whom rice is life,1
3,"An overview of global rice production, supply, trade, and consumption",rice is the staple food for over half the worlds population approximately  million metric tons of milled rice is produced annually china and india alone account for  of the rice grown and consumed rice provides up to  of the dietary caloric supply for millions living in poverty in asia and is therefore critical for food security it is becoming an important food staple in both latin america and africa record increases in rice production have been observed since the start of the green revolution however rice remains one of the most protected food commodities in world trade rice is a poor source of vitamins and minerals and losses occur during the milling process populations that subsist on rice are at high risk of vitamin and mineral deficiency improved technologies to fortify rice have the potential to address these deficiencies and their associated adverse health effects with the rice industry consolidating in many countries there are opportunities to fortify a significant share of rice for distribution or for use in government safety net programs that target those most in need especially women and children multisectoral approaches are needed for the promotion and implementation of rice fortification in countries,1
4,Current Status and Challenges of Rice Production in China,rice production in china has more than tripled in the past five decades mainly due to increased grain yield rather than increased planting area this increase has come from the development of highyielding varieties and improved crop management practices such as nitrogen fertilization and irrigation however yield stagnation of rice has been observed in the past ten years in china as its population rises china will need to produce about  more rice by  in order to meet its domestic needs if rice consumption per capita stays at the current level this is not an easy task because several trends and problems in the chinese rice production system constrain the sustainable increase in total rice production key trends include a decline in arable land increasing water scarcity global climate change labor shortages and increasing consumer demand for highquality rice which often comes from lowyielding varieties the major problems confronting rice production in china are narrow genetic background overuse of fertilizers and pesticides breakdown of irrigation infrastructure oversimplified crop management and a weak extension system despite these challenges good research strategies can drive increased rice production in china these include the development of new rice varieties with high yield potential improvement of resistances to major diseases and insects and to major abiotic stresses such as drought and heat and the establishment of integrated crop management we believe that a sustainable increase in rice production is achievable in china with the development of new technology through rice research,1

10,Climate Change Affecting Rice Production The Physiological and Agronomic Basis for Possible Adaptation Strategies,this review addresses possible adaptation strategies in rice production to abiotic stresses that will aggravate under climate change heat high temperature and humidity drought salinity and submergence each stress is discussed regarding the current state of knowledge on damage mechanism for rice plants as well as possible developments in germplasm and crop management technologies to overcome production losses higher temperatures can adversely affect rice yields through two principal pathways namely i high maximum temperatures that causein combination with high humidityspikelet sterility and adversely affect grain quality and ii increased nighttime temperatures that may reduce assimilate accumulation on the other hand some rice cultivars are grown in extremely hot environments so that the development of rice germplasm with improved heat resistance can capture an enormous genetic pool for this trait likewise drought is a common phenomenon in many rice growing environments and agriculture research has achieved considerable progress in terms of germplasm improvement and crop management ie water saving techniques to cope with the complexity of the drought syndrome rice is highly sensitive to salinity salinity often coincides with other stresses in rice production namely drought in inland areas or submergence in coastal areas submergence tolerance of rice plants has substantially been improved by introgressing the sub gene into popular rice cultivars in many asian rice growing areas,1
11,Soil quality and constraints in global rice production,we assessed soil quality in global rice production areas with the fertility capability soil classification fcc system adjusted to match the harmonized world soil database established by the food and agriculture organization and the international institute for applied systems analysis we computed the distribution of  soil constraints and used these to categorize soils as good poor very poor or problem soil for rice production these data were then combined with data of global rice distribution to determine soil quality in the main rice production systems around the world most rice is grown in asia  million ha followed by africa  million ha and the americas  million ha globally onethird of the total rice area is grown on very poor soils which includes  million ha of irrigated rice land  million ha in rainfed lowlands and  million ha of upland rice at least  million ha of rice is grown on problem soils including saline alkalinesodic acidsulfate and organic soils asia has the largest percentage of rice on good soils  whereas rice production on good soils is much less common in the americas  and accounts for only  in africa the most common soil chemical problems in rice fields are very low inherent nutrient status  million ha very low ph  million ha and high p fixation  million ha widespread soil physical problems especially severe in rainfed environments are very shallow soils and low waterholding capacity the results of the analysis can be used to better target crop improvement research plant breeding and the dissemination of stressspecific tolerant varieties and soil management technologies,1
12,Climate variability impacts on rice production in the Philippines,changes in crop yield and production over time are driven by a combination of genetics agronomics and climate disentangling the role of these various influences helps us understand the capacity of agriculture to adapt to change here we explore the impact of climate variability on rice yield and production in the philippines from  in both irrigated and rainfed production systems at various scales over this period rice production is affected by variations in soil moisture which are largely driven by the el niosouthern oscillation enso we found that the climate impacts on rice production are strongly seasonally modulated and differ considerably by region as expected rainfed upland rice production systems are more sensitive to soil moisture variability than irrigated paddy rice about  of the variance in rice production anomalies on the national level covaries with soil moisture changes which in turn are strongly negatively correlated with an index capturing enso variability our results show that while temperature variability is of limited importance in the philippines today future climate projections suggest that by the end of the century temperatures might regularly exceed known limits to rice production if warming continues unabated therefore skillful seasonal prediction will likely become increasingly crucial to provide the necessary information to guide agriculture management to mitigate the compounding impacts of soil moisture variability and temperature stress detailed case studies like this complement global yield studies and provide important local perspectives that can help in food policy decisions,1
