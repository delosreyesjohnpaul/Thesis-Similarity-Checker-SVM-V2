 Documents"," Plagiarism occurs when we use the ideas, expressions, work, and words of other authors and do not give them the required
 attribution. The major contributing factor in plagiarism is the availability of a high amount of data and information on the
 internet that can be swiftly accessed. The proposed system introduces an extrinsic plagiarism detection approach inspired by
 cognition because it utilizes semantic knowledge to detect the plagiarized part from the text without human involvement. A
 lexical database like WordNet assists the computers to perceive the data and information. These days most of the plagiarism
 detection systems fail to detect highly complex cases of plagiarism. The proposed system uses Dice measure as similarity
 measureforfindingthesemanticresemblancebetweenthepairofsentences.Italsouseslinguistic features like path similarity,
 depth estimation measure to computetheresemblancebetweenthepairofwordsandthesefeaturesarecombinedbyassigning
 different weights to them. It is capable of identifying cases like restructuring, paraphrasing, verbatim copy, and synonymized
 plagiarism. It has been evaluated on the PAN-PC-11 corpus. The results obtained from the proposed system signify that it
 has outperformed other existing systems on PAN-PC-11 in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and PlagDet score. The
 proposed system has innovative approach, but the results are somehow close and reasonably better than the existing systems.",1

2,Meeting the challenges of global rice production,"Rice is the second most widely grown cereal crop and the staple food for more than half the world's population. More than 3 billion people consume more than 100 kg of rice per year. Rice is cultivated on 155.5 million ha with an average growth rate of 0.39% a year, in the last 30 years. In the near future, the possibility for expanding areas under rice-based systems will remain very limited because of the scarcity of global water resources for agriculture, the expansion of urban and industrial sectors in Asia where land is already limited and the high costs of developing new lands that are suited for rice production in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. The average growth rate of rice yield was 3.68% per year in the early 1980s, but it has decreased to 0.74% per year in the late 1990s. Several factors may contribute to the decline of the area under cultivation and in yield growth. The most important of these factors are: limited returns as we approach the yield potential of the high yielding varieties, declining productivity in intensive rice production systems, pressures from abiotic and biotic stresses, low returns in developing countries, increasing production costs in industrialized countries, and increasing public concern for the protection of environmental resources. One of the most effective means of addressing the issues in rice cultivation and raising the average yields at the farm level is through research and subsequent dissemination of the resulting data. Rice science has made considerable progress. In the area of rice varietal improvement, recent advances in hybrid rice and the new rice for Africa (NERICA) are just two examples of the successful contributions of science to the development of rice. Research could also help reduce the gap between the potential yield obtained on experimental stations and the actual yield obtained in the fields. This could be possible by developing and promoting rice integrated crop management (RICM) systems for improving productivity and reducing the production cost per unit of output. The need for a sustainable increase in rice production affects everyone. The International Year of Rice provide us with a chance to improve food security, alleviate poverty and preserve the environment for the billions of people for whom Rice is Life.",1
3,"An overview of global rice production, supply, trade, and consumption","Rice is the staple food for over half the world's population. Approximately 480 million metric tons of milled rice is produced annually. China and India alone account for ?50% of the rice grown and consumed. Rice provides up to 50% of the dietary caloric supply for millions living in poverty in Asia and is, therefore, critical for food security. It is becoming an important food staple in both Latin America and Africa. Record increases in rice production have been observed since the start of the Green Revolution. However, rice remains one of the most protected food commodities in world trade. Rice is a poor source of vitamins and minerals, and losses occur during the milling process. Populations that subsist on rice are at high risk of vitamin and mineral deficiency. Improved technologies to fortify rice have the potential to address these deficiencies and their associated adverse health effects. With the rice industry consolidating in many countries, there are opportunities to fortify a significant share of rice for distribution or for use in government safety net programs that target those most in need, especially women and children. Multisectoral approaches are needed for the promotion and implementation of rice fortification in countries.",1
4,Current Status and Challenges of Rice Production in China,"Rice production in China has more than tripled in the past five decades mainly due to increased grain yield rather than increased planting area. This increase has come from the development of high-yielding varieties and improved crop management practices such as nitrogen fertilization and irrigation. However, yield stagnation of rice has been observed in the past ten years in China. As its population rises, China will need to produce about 20% more rice by 2030 in order to meet its domestic needs if rice consumption per capita stays at the current level. This is not an easy task because several trends and problems in the Chinese rice production system constrain the sustainable increase in total rice production. Key trends include a decline in arable land, increasing water scarcity, global climate change, labor shortages, and increasing consumer demand for high-quality rice (which often comes from low-yielding varieties). The major problems confronting rice production in China are narrow genetic background, overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, breakdown of irrigation infrastructure, oversimplified crop management, and a weak extension system. Despite these challenges, good research strategies can drive increased rice production in China. These include the development of new rice varieties with high yield potential, improvement of resistances to major diseases and insects, and to major abiotic stresses such as drought and heat, and the establishment of integrated crop management. We believe that a sustainable increase in rice production is achievable in China with the development of new technology through rice research.",1

11,Rice Production Systems,"Rice is grown in more than 100 countries spread across six continents and in varying agroecological and socioeconomic conditions. Rice production systems were classified over years differently depending on the context. In this chapter, the method of rice establishment is considered as criteria for classifying rice production systems across the globe. An attempt is made here to summarize the information on rice production systems, resources used, crop productivity attained, the challenges encountered, and possible research needs for improving productivity in rice production systems, to meet the future food demands. Based on the major methods of rice establishment of the world, the rice production systems are categorized as (a) transplanted rice (TPR) production systems and (b) direct-seeded rice (DSR) production systems. DSR production systems are further categorized as (i) dry-seeded rice (dry-DSR) production system, (ii) wet-seeded rice (wet-DSR) production system, and (iii) water-seeded rice (water-DSR) production system. The productivity of TPR and DSR was reported to be similar when the best management practices are adopted. As already occurred in the developed world, a shift in adoption toward DSR production systems is occurring in developing world, due to advantages of DSR production systems such as lesser cost of production, increased resource (water, labor, and energy) use efficiency, and income compared to TPR. Lower environmental footprint was found to be another advantage of DSR production systems when they were combined with other conservation agricultural practices. The need for continuous research efforts was stressed for understanding the evolving rice production systems across the globe and to develop practical integrated crop management strategies that improve rice productivity and production effectively, sustainably, and economically with minimal environment footprint.",1
12,Increasing Rice Production in Sub-Saharan Africa: Challenges and Opportunities,"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces multiple problems. The main one is improving the lives of the 30% of its population that suffers from extreme poverty and food insecurity. As more than 70% of the population lives off farming and related activities, agricultural development will have to play a major role in improving this situation. Fortunately, Africa has an abundant supply of natural resources that can support a huge expansion in food, specifically rice production. Because of strong demand, rice area expansion in SSA is larger than for any other crop. Total milled rice production increased from 2.2 million Mg in 1961 to 9.1 million Mg in 2004. Rice imports into SSA also increased from 0.5 million Mg of milled rice in 1961 to 6.0 million Mg in 2003 and SSA currently accounts for 25% of global rice imports, at a cost of more than US$1.5 billion per year. Therefore, many African governments accord high priority to developing their local rice sector as an important component of national food security, economic growth, and poverty alleviation. The abundant supply of agroclimatically suitable wetlands (~239 million ha) and water resources can support a large expansion in rice area and productivity. Currently, less than 5% of the potentially suitable wetlands are planted with rice because of various constraints. Expansion and intensification of rice cultivation in SSA will not compete with other crops in terms of land and water resources because, during the rainy season, only rice can be grown on low-lying wetlands, including inland valleys. In addition, the labor-intensive nature of rice cultivation will provide additional sources of work and income to the rural poor, especially women. Should labor shortages become acute, however, appropriate mechanization can be considered. Small farmers want to earn money from rice farming, but lack modern inputs and capital to fully exploit their rice lands as these items are limited or not available. This is where an innovative public–private partnership is desirable to support the intensification of rice farming.",1
13,Rice Production in Asia: Key to Global Food Security,Eating a mix of fruits and vegetables is part of a healthy diet.,1
14,New York City is known for its bustling Times Square.,"Rice is the staple food for over half of the global population. About 90% of the global rice is produced and consumed in Asia. Hence, rice production in Asia is the key for global food security. The growth in rice production with stability has been a matter of concern to achieve food security, especially in developing countries. In this backdrop, the present paper attempts to study the area and production growth rates of major rice growing countries of Asia. Also, the export growth rates were estimated and the contribution of major rice growing countries of Asia to Global food security was quantified for the period between 1994 and 2013. The trends from the year 1964 for area and production were analyzed. For exports, the trends have been analysed from the year 1984. The results revealed that there was a rapid increase in production of rice during 2004–2013 mainly because of increase in area and also because of increased investment in agriculture. The growth rate of exports has declined and stood at 4.01% during 2004–2012. This is mainly because of 2008 rice crisis that has provided impetus to expanded rice production in several rice importing countries. The study suggests that, for expansion of international trade, the governments will need to adopt measures that reduce supply chain loss, improve supply response time, reduce the market costs and post harvest loss.",1
15,Major Constraints for Global Rice Production,"Global mean air temperature is projected to rise by 1.4–5.8°C from 1990–2100, due to increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Investigations predict that in 21st century the sea level may rise by 1 m or more, which would adversely affect one billion people by 2050. Coastal regions, being major irrigated rice-growing zones, are prone to be devastated by climate change, loss of wetlands, heightened storm damage, and increased salinity from saltwater intrusion. Scientists reported 23% improvement in rice-grain yield due to increasing CO2 from 365 to 627 mg kg?1; however, this increase is nullified by increasing mean air temperature. Both low and high temperature at high and low altitude respectively, reduce rice yield. Scientists found a 10% decrease in rice yield by per degree centigrade increase in minimum temperature. Similarly, decrease in rice yield was noticed in many parts of the world due to scarcity of good quality water, drought, salinity, land degradation, poor weed control, low input use, uneven patterns of rainfall, high disease occurrence, poor soil fertility, and some socioeconomic issues. Therefore, integrated management systems must be developed through eco-friendly agronomic practices, research, and modeling to overcome these hurdles for obtaining sustainable and profitable productivity of rice.",1
